# Housing-Price-Prediction
Predicting housing prices using regularized regression 
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set  from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.
The goal of this case study is to identify the factors which are most significant in predicting house prices and how well are they able to describe the price of the house.
Using Ridge and Lasso regressions models were built and accuracy and other metrics were analysed and we finally concluded that Lasso despite giving slightly less accuracy gives us 43% less number of features which is a added advantage because we have the list of top 20 factors / features to be accounted for predicting house prices.
